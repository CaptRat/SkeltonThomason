                                    To live in the present moment is a miracle.<br>
                                    The miracle is not to walk on water, the miracle is to walk on the green Earth in the present moment.<br>
                                    To appreciate the peace and beauty that are available now.<br>
                                    Peace is all around us - in the world and in nature - and within us - in our bodies and our spirits.<br>
                                    Once we learn to touch this peace, we will be healed and transformed.<br>
                                    It is not a matter of faith: it is a matter of practice.
