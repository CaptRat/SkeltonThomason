                            <p>It all begins with a phone call. Each family’s situation is unique, and we will work together to determine if it is time to pursue an out-of-home intervention.</p>
                            <p>The relationship between the family and the consultant is very important. Parents and the consultant will form a team, working closely to find the best treatment fit for the adolescent/young adult. A strong family-consultant relationship is one of honesty, mutual respect and trust. We will advocate for and support each family every step of the way. We ease the inevitable bumps that occur as our clients embark upon the journey of making long term change. We have been privileged to accompany many families on this journey, many times over the past fifteen years. In addition to working closely with parents, we enlist the adolescent/young adult as a primary resource when we feel that they are in a position to be a healthy part of the team.</p>

                            <p>The placement needs of our clients are varied. It is important to us to understand and respect the unique circumstances of each family with whom we work. There is no “recipe” for success. Each client brings their own set of strengths and struggles to the table. With appreciation and respect for the individual, we guide the family to the right choice for treatment. There are a multitude of factors we consider when making a placement, based on the issues at hand. The placement options we recommend can include:</p>
                               <ul>
                                   <li>Therapeutic Boarding schools</li>
                                   <li>Outdoor Wilderness Therapeutic Programs</li>
                                   <li>Chemical Dependency Recovery Programs</li>
                                   <li>Residential Treatment Centers</li>
                                   <li>Specialty Schools for those with unique learning needs</li>
                                   <li>Schools for Gifted Students</li>
                                   <li>Transitional Independent Living Programs for 18-27 year olds</li>
                                </ul>

                            <p>In order to guide a family to the best possible placement, we use the following process:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Definition of Goals: A thorough interview is conducted with parents in order to understand the family's goals, and parents are asked to complete our online application. If the adolescent/young adult is willing and able to be a part of this process pre-treatment, we encourage their input.</li>

                                <li>Consultation: Meetings are set with the child when appropriate and/or with significant professionals, educators, therapists, probation officers, etc., who know the child well and whose perspective can assist us in the process of choosing the best possible program.</li>
                            
                                <li>Review: School transcripts and any previous psychological testing and educational testing are examined. In some cases the need for further testing is determined and we can assist families in connecting with the appropriate resources.</li>

                                <li>Selection: Recommendations for schools, treatment resources and other professional services best suited to the needs of the family are made. These recommendations will be consistent with formal professional assessments, personality traits of the child, financial resources available, and any other matters that are relevant to the family </li>
                            </ul>
