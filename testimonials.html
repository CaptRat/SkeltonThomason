                            <p class="text-center pre-scrollable">"My wife and I met Deborah in the midst of crisis over what to do with our son. He was out of control and headed down a dangerous path. Deborah was a voice of calm, support and hope in the midst of a very dark and frightening time for us. She spent hours with us, even before we had decided what to do, and patiently described the options and overall processes available to provide help for our son. Once she became our education consultant, she was a tenacious advocate for our family. She was in constant communication throughout the entire time helping us understand and evaluate options and gauge process during the time our son was away. She connected us with exceptional programs and facilities that on our own, we never would have been able to engage with or even identify. Our son has now completed his 2nd year of University and is on his way to a career and successful life on his own. We have a relationship with him that is loving and positive. I highly recommend Deborah for her knowledge, commitment and expertise."</p>

                             <p class="text-center pre-scrollable">"We wasted over a year placing our son in the wrong school. The placement occurred after we had done a great deal of research, talked to parents whose children attended the school, and visited the school personally. At the time we saw no reason to use a professional because we were willing to invest the time and energy into finding the right placement for our son. After connecting, you placed our son in a great setting for him and us. The placement occurred after several meetings during which you connected with our son and found out what he wanted in a school. My only regret is that it took us so long to find you."</p>

                          <p class="text-center pre-scrollable">"What can we say about a person who was pivotal in saving our family and saving our daughter’s life? Without Deborah Thomason we would have stayed stuck in the nightmare of having an alcoholic self-destructive child. With her help we found, not only hope and peace, but also an effective customized plan to move forward. Our daughter experienced treatment success and graduated high school. What followed was a long relapse and treatment failure. Eventually, at 23, our daughter called Deborah herself to be expertly matched with an adult program and with a phenomenal therapist at that program. Now she is sober, incredibly happy, and starting her career within the treatment industry. She has found her calling in life! Importantly, Deborah was with us every step of the way on this journey. We will never be able to express what this has meant to us. Deborah Thomason, and those in the programs she chose for us, saved our daughter’s life, our marriage, and the very life of our family itself. We recommend her without reservation, to anyone and any family searching for help and resolution. Her experience, honor, insight, and incredible work ethic were beyond our expectations. Thank you so much"</p>
